About Spuul
Spuul is a Singapore based Over the Top (OTT) video streaming service, targeted at the South Asian market and the South Asian diaspora. We take entertainment very seriously, and we’re looking for someone who can identify problems and then help us solve them, in order to deliver unlimited, quality entertainment to our ~12 million users across the globe.

About The Team
We’re about 40 of us across three locations working hard to make sure we’re always ahead of the game. At Spuul, it’s never ‘just a job’ and life doesn’t end at 5 pm. But, it doesn’t begin at 9 am either! And if you think you can be a good fit, we’d love for you to get to know us, so you can understand who to bother when you’re facing an issue, or whom to catch when you find a mistake.

How We Care For Spuulers
Grow With Us
We’re a small team with big dreams and we’re looking for people who aren’t afraid to dream with us. We’ll hire you because you know something we probably don’t, and we’d like you to help us fix it. We’re a rapidly growing business in an ever-evolving industry, and we’d like for you to be a part of this growth.

Your Time Is Important
Whether it’s an emergency, an occasion, or you just need a break from every day routine, our open leave policy and flexible work hours allow you to manage your personal time and business requirements such that a healthy balance is both achieved and maintained. There’s no ‘one size fits all’ recipe here, and you can decide when you’d like some time off, and you can decide how much time you need off.

Only Your Work Speaks For You
Just because you like wearing shorts, it doesn’t mean you aren’t serious about your work, contrary to popular perception. We don’t have a dress code and we probably never will. Our CEO walks into office with his collars turned up, and you’re free to come dressed in a three piece suit if you please! The only thing that will leave a lasting impression is every one of your contributions, no matter how big or small.

SECONDMENT - Criminal Intelligence Officer,"INTERPOL is an equal opportunity employer and welcomes the applications of all qualified candidates who are nationals of INTERPOL member countries, irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin, opinions or beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, health or disabilities.

INTERPOL places no restrictions on the eligibility of candidates, without distinction as to race or ethnic origin, religion, opinions, gender, sexual orientation or disabilities. However, the national policy and laws in force in INTERPOL host countries may mean that staff members’ spouses or partners, while legally recognized by the Organization, are not given the same recognition when they reside in certain duty stations. When this is the case, the Organization will inform the candidates accordingly to ensure that they are aware of the situation and allow them to make an informed decision.

Confidentiality Regime

In application of Article 114.1 of INTERPOL’s Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD), the General Secretariat is “responsible for determining authorization procedures or a system of security clearance at each data confidentiality level”. Member states which are not able or willing to assist INTERPOL in performing such a check should be aware that some INTERPOL information might not be made available to their nationals working at INTERPOL.

In order to be able to access police information classified as “INTERPOL For official use only” or “INTERPOL RESTRICTED”, the individual has to obtain “INTERPOL Restricted” security clearance. This clearance is granted after Basic security screening.

For seconded or other officials assigned to work or assist at the General Secretariat by a member country, in lieu of Basic security screening, the respective NCB shall attest that the equivalent of the INTERPOL Basic security screening has been satisfactorily completed. This means that the following verifications will not be performed by the General Secretariat but are considered to have been taken care of by the respective NCB.

In order to be able to access police information classified as “INTERPOL CONFIDENTIAL”, the individual has to obtain “INTERPOL Confidential” security clearance. This clearance is granted after Enhanced security screening.

Under no circumstances should clearance be granted simply because of an official’s rank, post held, or length of service. Staff may only gain access to General Secretariat premises and to police information if the appropriate INTERPOL security clearance has been obtained. In order to reduce the secondment timeline, and as the Enhanced security screening may take some time, the seconded Official requiring INTERPOL Confidential security clearance may be authorized to start the secondment if the NCB can confirm that the equivalent to Basic security screening has been performed. Access to INTERPOL CONFIDENTIAL information will not be authorized until Enhanced security screening is confirmed.",Interpol,None

With a Satmetrix NPS score in the top 1% of B2B companies worldwide, our customer-first culture and dedication to innovation build a fast-growing company that employees, customers, partners, and investors love. For more information on our business, check out the corporate fact sheet here.

Over the past two decades, we've seen data center infrastructure and data protection strategies evolve from ""disk-to-tape-to-truck"" … to ""disk-to-disk-to-tape"" … to ""flash-to-disk-to-disk"". Performance, data availability, and data insight requirements—- forged together with the evolution of flash economics—- have taken most production environments from disk to flash. The need to rapidly restore critical data sets combined with the dream for organizations to demonstrate a multi-cloud strategy, is leading us into a flash-to-flash-to-cloud world, and Pure is leading the way.

What You Will Be Doing

FlashBlade (FB) was designed from the ground up to serve as a Dynamic Data Hub that eliminates silos across backup, analytics, and AI workflows. Customers frustrated by slow restore times associated with legacy PBBA platforms can dramatically improve RTO and RPO by using FlashBlade as a backup target—- with the investment protection of a Data Hub foundation that supports next generation workloads such as aAnalytics.

Our mission is to make FB the obvious choice due to its proven scalable backup and restore performance, capacity, density and simplicity. The recent addition of StorReduce technology to the Pure Storage portfolio will improve the offering by providing deduplication as well as cloud mobility capabilities.

As a FB Solution Specialist, you will promote Pure in data protection opportunities. Consult and advise customers on crafting, managing, and scaling systems for backup/rapid restore, as well as help in competitive analysis, crafting POCs, and benchmarking.

Recruitment Coordinator APAC,"Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 6 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 6 years and we operate in 14 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

The Team

The recruitment team has played a huge part in Deliveroo's story so far and is key to the company's future success. We're responsible for supporting the business globally by owning the recruitment process of key hires and constantly improving our assessment approach. We're a team consisting of about 28 people, spread across the UK, Europe and APAC, whilst you'll be the first Recruitment Co-ordinator based outside the UK, you will help shape the function in the APAC market.

The Role

This role will be working with the Business organisation which has ambitious growth plans in 2019, we're aiming for our third consecutive year of doubling the team. You'll be working closely with candidates, the recruitment team and hiring teams to support the recruitment process. Your main responsibilities will include scheduling interviews, generating contracts for new starters, organising travel as well as tracking interviewer load, interviewer on-boarding, managing recruitment agencies, arranging debriefs and managing our applicant tracking system.

Requirements


At least 1 year of interview scheduling and coordination experience.
Ideally, you'll have worked in a Recruitment Coordination capacity in a high volume recruitment environment, scheduling multiple interviews and loops for candidates.
A track record of being proactive enough to look beyond the day to day activity and suggest/ implement process improvements both in the recruitment team and the hiring process.
Experience of running projects that will benefit the recruitment process and candidate experience.
Ability to prioritise across multiple tasks with a focus on time and expectation management and to take a self-starting approach to your day
Strong communication skills as you'll be working closely with our candidates to give them a great experience and to create a seamless recruitment process for our hiring managers/interviewers
Remarkable attention to detail with a desire to complete tasks and follow up to make sure everything runs smoothly
There's so much to do and we want someone who is committed to growing their own career, taking responsibility for their own development in the role and finding new projects or processes that will help our company scale.
Experience of using an applicant tracking system is essential, we use Greenhouse, but any ATS will be helpful.
Fluency in English is required and proficiency in Mandarin or Cantonese is a plus.
Bachelor's Degree required.

Life at Deliveroo

We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around.",Deliveroo,None

Operations Manager,"Who we are

Open Government Products is an in-house team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build technology for the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.

Projects we have worked on include:

Data.gov.sg - An open repository of all the Singapore Government’s public data. It helps people understand the data using visualizations and articles, and provides real-time APIs for developers to use.
Beeline - A data-driven shuttle bus platform. Bus routes are created from user suggestions and public transport usage data. Users can book, pay for, and track rides using a mobile app.
Parking.sg - A mobile app alternative to parking coupons. It lets users pay, extend, and refund their parking sessions just using their phones.
Form.sg - A form builder tool for agencies to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.

What does an Operations Manager do?

As an Operations manager, your role is to oversee, strategise and implement solutions to support various functions in the team. This will involve taking concrete steps such as working closely with team members to identify and troubleshoot operational and procedural obstacles so as to help the team achieve its full potential. You will be responsible for ensuring that the team is running as smoothly as possible to enable efficient and high quality delivery of products and services to the public.

Concretely this comprises responsibilities across process improvements, resource management and workspace management:


Identifying and setting up software solutions to automate work processes
Overseeing the proper filing of and compliance with legal and regulatory documents such as contracts and government policies
Managing the team budget and tracking expenditure to maintain cost-efficiency
Writing budget and procurement approvals, and collaborating with the legal and finance teams to secure the needed approvals
Ensuring that the team is adequately resourced financially, logistically and administratively
Handling day-to-day operational matters such as keeping the workspace well-maintained
Helping with the on-boarding and off-boarding of staff
Proactively reviewing and optimising current processes and systems, including but not limited to: the recruitment process, on-boarding process, procurement process, communications platform, resource booking system, asset management system, budgeting tools etc.

What it is like working here

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Doing that which you believe in is the best way to do what works best for the team.

Continuous Learning - Working on new approaches often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to study industry best practices and learning cross-functional skills (e.g. software engineers learn UX design) is not just encouraged but essential.

We look for people who:

Have experience in Operations, Public Service, Change Management, or related fields - You should have minimum 2 years’ experience working in a fast paced environment. Experience working in a tech organization is a plus.
Are well-organised with a keen attention to detail - You need to follow through with solutions, from conception to implementation to maintenance.
Are innovative problem-solvers - You need to critically evaluate the ways in which the team can be run more optimally, and be able to think out-of-the-box when coming up with solutions.
Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction.
Have solid communication skills - You need to be able to write clearly and concisely, and know how to get people working together
Have good emotional intelligence - You need to have a good sense of the team’s working dynamics and build trust with various stakeholders.
Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest.

About Teralytics

Teralytics is on a mission to change how the world moves.

Until now, cities and mobility services have been designed based on assumptions of how officials and companies expect people to move. But, they aren't taking everyone's journey into consideration. As a result, for many, mobility is limited. Not just physically, but socially and economically. It's stopping people from reaching their full potential.

Teralytics partners with mobile network operators to solve this problem with the most accurate indicator of people's movement – their mobile devices. It's the one thing everyone has with them at all times. And the cell towers receiving their signals don't discriminate based on device model or apps. Due to its complexity and scale, mobile network data has been nearly impossible to understand or utilize. That's why we've pioneered a way to translate it into actionable insights.

Teralytics is backed by some of the best VC companies in the world, such as Atomico, Lakestar and Horizons Ventures, and we are continuing to grow across the world. Whether at our headquarters in Zurich or in our offices in New York and Singapore, our people are at the core of our mission to shape the future of mobility.

At the same time, the increasing coupling between the heat and electricity sectors makes it possible to transfer thermal and electrical flexibility potentials into one another. Buildings have an intrinsic flexibility potential resulting from the thermal storage capacities of the building itself, but also from technical facilities such as heat storage units. When exploiting this potential, restrictions arise from the operation of the building: in the case of office buildings, this is particularly the user comfort. In the context of energy-flexible building operation, the maintenance of a comfortable indoor climate must therefore be proactively taken into account. For this purpose, models of the room climate must be integrated directly into the control system of the building (MPC - model predictive control). The corresponding model must fit to the mathematical characteristics of the optimization approach and be able to adequately predict the relevant parameters of the indoor climate depending on the operation of the building, the occupancy and the environmental conditions.


About this position

Within the research platform TUMCREATE in Singapore, a Control-oriented Building Climate Model (CoBMo) was developed, based on the representation by thermal resistances and capacities (R-C models). The core capability of the associated Python-based modelling tool is to derive linear building climate models in the form of state space matrices. The CoBMo defines data structures for building layout and comprises component models for the influence of ambient air, solar radiation, users, devices and the HVAC system on the building climate, i.e. thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The previous component models are based on the rooms of TUMCREATE in Singapore. The objective of the thesis is to extend CoBMo by corresponding mathematical component models to apply to other offices and rooms.

There will be support provided by scientific associate who was significantly involved in the preparatory work in form of the existing models.


Main tasks

Formulation and implementation of component models for radiator heating systems and thermal building component activations
Integration of the new models into the numerical optimization system
Application of the linear building climate model to a zone of a selected office building
Validation of the results on the basis of measurement data or reference models (e.g. EnergyPlus etc.)


Requirements

Enrolled Bachelor and Master students
Good knowledge of thermodynamics + heating, ventilation and air conditioning
Experience with Python / Pandas and object-oriented programming is an advantage
Reliable, independent and scientific way of working


What we offer

Exposure to the state of the art research topics
An international and multidisciplinary working environment
Guidance by researchers from world-renowned universities
Opportunity for publishing in international journals and conferences

SECONDMENT - Cybercrime Intelligence Officer,"INTERPOL is an equal opportunity employer and welcomes the applications of all qualified candidates who are nationals of INTERPOL member countries, irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin, opinions or beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, health or disabilities.

INTERPOL places no restrictions on the eligibility of candidates, without distinction as to race or ethnic origin, religion, opinions, gender, sexual orientation or disabilities. However, the national policy and laws in force in INTERPOL host countries may mean that staff members’ spouses or partners, while legally recognized by the Organization, are not given the same recognition when they reside in certain duty stations. When this is the case, the Organization will inform the candidates accordingly to ensure that they are aware of the situation and allow them to make an informed decision.

Confidentiality Regime

In application of Article 114.1 of INTERPOL’s Rules on the Processing of Data (RPD), the General Secretariat is “responsible for determining authorization procedures or a system of security clearance at each data confidentiality level”. Member states which are not able or willing to assist INTERPOL in performing such a check should be aware that some INTERPOL information might not be made available to their nationals working at INTERPOL.

In order to be able to access police information classified as “INTERPOL For official use only” or “INTERPOL RESTRICTED”, the individual has to obtain “INTERPOL Restricted” security clearance. This clearance is granted after Basic security screening.

For seconded or other officials assigned to work or assist at the General Secretariat by a member country, in lieu of Basic security screening, the respective NCB shall attest that the equivalent of the INTERPOL Basic security screening has been satisfactorily completed. This means that the following verifications will not be performed by the General Secretariat but are considered to have been taken care of by the respective NCB.

In order to be able to access police information classified as “INTERPOL CONFIDENTIAL”, the individual has to obtain “INTERPOL Confidential” security clearance. This clearance is granted after Enhanced security screening.

Under no circumstances should clearance be granted simply because of an official’s rank, post held, or length of service. Staff may only gain access to General Secretariat premises and to police information if the appropriate INTERPOL security clearance has been obtained. In order to reduce the secondment timeline, and as the Enhanced security screening may take some time, the seconded Official requiring INTERPOL Confidential security clearance may be authorized to start the secondment if the NCB can confirm that the equivalent to Basic security screening has been performed. Access to INTERPOL CONFIDENTIAL information will not be authorized until Enhanced security screening is confirmed.",Interpol,None

Recruitment Sourcer APAC,"Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 6 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 6 years and we operate in 14 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

And we're just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

What you'll be working on


A lot of hiring! The APAC recruitment team supports business hiring which for Deliveroo is everything non-tech across 6 markets: Australia, UAE, Kuwait, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
You'll strategize different ways to build talent pipelines and execute on tactical research, referral generation, events and sourcing campaigns.
Find and engage active or passive candidates by using our ATS, Boolean, LinkedIn and alternative search techniques
You'll work with recruiter(s) and hiring managers to effectively qualify specific criteria and skill sets for each role and generate creative sourcing strategies.
Partner with hiring managers to build a scalable recruiting process.
Create tracking systems, metrics and reports to demonstrate successful lead generation of candidates throughout the different stages of the interview process.

Job requirements and things we'd like to see in you


3+ years of sourcing or recruiting experience with a search firm or in-house recruitment team.
You will utilize multiple recruiting resources and advanced sourcing techniques to identify talent.
Proactivity. You identify areas for improvement and build hiring solutions that can help us scale.
People skills. You believe in the power of communication and focus on building relationships long term.
A passion for an amazing and seamless interview experience for both candidates and hiring teams.
You leverage data to drive sourcing strategies and influence hiring managers.
You thrive in an environment of unrelenting pace. The ability to multitask, juggle a bunch of stuff at once but also, somehow manage to be super organised at the same time is key here.
Fluency in an APAC language is a plus.
Bachelor's degree required.
Most importantly, you love food and are excited about influencing the way people eat globally!

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.
